                        * You will hesitate to ever name another variable (or function, or...)
                        * You may never read another software patent 
                        * You may consider a career as an Expert Witness

                        * I worked directly on the (allegedly) infringing software: transparent proxies for SMTP and FTP, as well as an anti-virus scanning engine.

                        * Doorman at Willard Hotel in Washington DC was an amateur cryptozoolist (I talked to him about Ogopogo a lot)

                        * <p class="fragment roll-in">When writing documentation, consider: How can this be manipulated in court when I'm being cross-examined about it?</p>
